# OkiJob
Oki job is a webapp for managing the ship and modifications shop as well as job assignments and requisitions for Okim Industries. The webapp itself is a Blazor webassembly project, with data being fed from an ASP.NET Entity Framework Core REST API.

Currently work is focused solely on the API and getting it to basic functionality. Once sufficient progress has been made, work can start on the webapp.
